		<div>NEXT</div>
		<div>The Deprived Ant</div>
		<div>Ants were the most responsible creatures in the land of UZ. Give an ant a task to do and if he didn't get it done, he died trying. It is no wonder that ants working together as a colony were so successful. This is the tale of the ants downfall and why there are no more ants in the Land of UZ.</div>
		<div>Back</div>
		<div>Ants weren't born with responsibility; they had to learn it. All young ants were taught the discipline and obligation necessary for responsibility.</div>
		<div>By the time they were adults they were ready to take their rightful place in productive ant society. They never shirked or complained about the task assigned them. Each ant could be depended on to perform his task and the colony grew and prospered.</div>
		<div>That is until the grasshopper exacted his revenge.</div>
		<div>One winter long ago the ants had refused to give the grasshopper all the food they had stored away. Ever since that winter the grasshopper had blamed all his misfortunes on the ants. Whenever the wind would blow him off a stalk of grass he would blame it on the ants. “It’s those ants,” he would say to himself. “If they had given me the food I had asked for I would be a lot stronger and the wind couldn't blow me around.” </div>
		<div>When it rained and his wings got wet he would say, "If those ants had fed me, the water would just roll off my wings." </div>
		<div>When the sun beat down on his head he would blame his discomfort on the ants. "If they had given me food that winter I would have been strong enough to build a house where I could shelter from the sun," he would say to himself. </div>
		<div>The grasshopper was an expert in blame.</div>
		<div>Over the years the grasshopper cultivated his hatred for the ants and waited for the time when he could get his revenge. It came one hot day as he watched a little ant struggling  as he dragged a huge leaf toward the ant hill.
"Why do you keep struggling with that big leaf?" asked the grasshopper.</div>
		<div>"It is my job," said the little ant."Why don't you quit?" asked the grasshopper.“That would not be responsible," replied the little ant."Don't worry," said the grasshopper."  All you have to do is blame your quitting on something else.""Blame," asked the ant. "What is that?” You see ants being responsible creatures did not understand the concept of blame but the grasshopper did."Blame is a very powerful tool," said the grasshopper. “You can use it to eliminate responsibility, and thus lessen your burdens and make life easier for yourself."</div>
		<div>The ant listened intently to everything the grasshopper said.   Then lay down the heavy leaf he had been carrying and returned to the nest to rest.</div>
		<div>When the rest of the ants returned to the nest they asked the ant why he had quit.
"Because as a young ant I was deprived of a healthy diet and now because of my weakened state I should not be expected to do the work of a healthy ant.”</div>
		<div>"Wait until the queen ant hears this," laughed the other ants. "Then you  really will be deprived.”  So they took the ant before the queen ant.     The ant explained his childhood deprivation to the queen while the rest of the ants waited for her wrathful reply. To their surprise none came. Instead the queen was sympathetic to the little ant's tale of deprivation and relieved him of his responsibility.</div>
		<div>The rest of the ants were amazed."How can you avoid responsibility?" they asked, and the little ant explained the concept of blame.    The ants were quick learners and more and more tasks went undone as they became adept at using blame to avoid their responsibilities.</div>
		<div>Soon the ant hill was in a shambles. Necessary repairs to the hill failed to be made and food was not gathered to fill the store rooms. Work in the ant colony came to a stand still, but the seasons didn't and when the cold of winter returned the colony was not prepared. The ant hill was in disrepair and could not keep out the cold. There was no food in their storage bins to eat when the world outside was frozen. Soon the ants began to die and by spring there were no longer any ants in the land.</div>
		<div>At first the grasshopper was very pleased with himself. He had gotten his revenge, that is until the wind blew him off the grass and the rain wet his wings. You see without the ants there was no one left to blame and he had to take responsibility for his own actions. "Being responsible isn't much fun," he thought. "Things were so much easier when I could blame it on the ants."                                                                      The End</div>
